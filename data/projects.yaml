- name: "MapReduce and Raft implementation - labs from MIT 6.824"
  date: "2020.04"
  details:
    "Followed lectures and materials from MIT graduate course 6.824 on distributed systems, finished lab1 and lab2abc, built a) a crash-tolerant master/worker MapReduce framework, and b) a Raft implementation supporting AppendEntries and RequestVote RPC for leader election, log replication and reboot recovery."
- name: "KvStore - A networked persistent log-structure key/value store"
  date: "2020.02"
  details: "Built a client/server style key/value store. The backend serializes randomly accessed data into a continuous stream using the log-structure approach, in the meantime, supports garbage collection of out-of-date data.
